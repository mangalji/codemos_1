Firstly you have the <b>python</b> with latest version in your system.

After all of these:    

install the mysql connector in your system:

- go to the folder where your <i>file</i> is located or which <i>folder</i> you created for this project.
- now create the **virtual environment** in your folder:
  - type:  python -m venv <venv name>.
  - here the mean of venv is: v for virtual and env for environment.
  - after create the venv we need to activate it.
